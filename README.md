# Ad-Renewal-Automation #
Renewing a Kijiji ad every 2 hours using the Selenium library for browser interaction and subprocess library for scheduling

## Description ##

This Python project automates the process of posting ads on Kijiji. The script automates the process of managing and posting ads on the Kijiji platform, ensuring a streamlined and efficient workflow. Given that Kijijiâ€™s algorithm detects duplicate ads and penalizes repeated content, the automation smartly deletes existing ads before re-posting them to maintain compliance with platform rules. This also avoids clutter and helps keep the number of active ads manageable. It also supports running every 2 hours to ensure ads are frequently updated. The automation is built using Selenium for browser interaction and Python subprocess for scheduling.

Features:
- Automated login and ad posting on Kijiji.
- Scheduled task execution every 2 hours.
- Ability to delete or update specific ads based on title.
- Handles multiple images and file uploads efficiently.

Technologies:
- Python
- Selenium WebDriver
- Keyboard/Mouse Automation

## Notes ##

In my code, Kijiji_Ad_Automation, I initially hardcoded the login credentials directly in the script, but this is not a good security practice. A better approach is to store the login information in a separate, secure file (e.g., a text file or environment variables) and have the script read the credentials from there.
